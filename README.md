# Projects 

This repository contains all the documents required for the projects completed as part of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree program.  

## Project 1 - Analyzing the New York Subway Dataset

In this project, I created a linear regression model to predict the number of riders on the NYC subway and used the Mann-Whitney U test to determine if the average number of riders was higher for days when it rained as opposed to days when it did not. The dataset was a mixture of weather and subway ridership data. For me, the main points of interest were: developing an understanding of how to select features for the model and being able to answer the question 'Is the model a good fit?'

Files and code can be found in ../Project 1/revised_submission folder and the main document is 'revised-AnalyzingtheNYCSubwayDataset.pdf'.

## Project 2 - Data Wrangling OpenStreetMaps Data

In this project, I audited and cleaned OpenStreetMap data for the Cleveland, OH and neighboring area. The original XML OSM data file was parsed and problems with street names, street types, zip codes, and city information were identified and programmatically fixed. The cleaned data was then reformatted and exported in JSON format for insertion into MongoDB. Basics stats were then gleaned via Mongo queries on the database.

Files and code can be found in ../Project 2 folder and the main document is 'Project2OpenStreetMapData.pdf'.
